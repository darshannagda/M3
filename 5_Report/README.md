## M3_WIPER_CONTROL_SYSTEM
I would like to mention that, differing from the fact that practically everything about this design has previously been ddescribed well, there are still a number of changes that may be deployed to make it even more easy to use. In terms of effectiveness and cost efficient, the project that we have built and reported is pretty sufficient by itself. When put together to the optical sensor, it has prominenet boons in that it can fit in all of the design framework as well as the needs of the user. These type of projects are beneficial in future-use by the addition of a speed-controlling mechanism, which will allow it to work in commensurate with the intensity and speed of the water flowing through the sensor. The basic operating is done in order to make it more cost-effecient and dependable for the upcoming days.The idea is to implement such kind of working conditions that can be used in any type of automobiles.The wiper system can be made automatic by adding the sensors for rain water falling on the wind shiled using sensos such as dust resistance sensor,etc.So,while driving the car the wiper system is controlled automatically.It can be more efective and convinientif  we add the add-on features to the wiper system this is achievable near future.Users all around the world are still working on this project so that a system csn be made that requires less human intervention.
