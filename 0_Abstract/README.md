# CAR_WIPER_CONTROL

A device that cleans the front window of a car of rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water, and/or debris is a windscreen wiper, sometimes also  known as a windshield wiper or wiper blade in American English. Nearly all the vehicles, including automobiles, cars, buses, trains, and cabin watercrafts—as well as some aircraft—have one or more of these wipers, that are usually required as per the rules and regulations.A metal arm with one end pivoting and the other end having a long rubber blade attached makes up the wiper.
In this,hand-operated power is utilised as well in some vehicles apart from a motor, usually an electric motor that drives the arm.To remove any water, any precipitation, or other obstructions to view,the blade is swung back and forth across the glass. On vehicles built after 1969,speed is usually changeable with various continuous speeds and often one or more interrupted settings. Many commercial cars use one or more pantograph arms i.e. overhead lines, while most personal autos use two synchronised radial-type arms.To improve and broaden the wiper(s) function to dry or icy conditions,a windscreen washer system is also employed on some vehicles . Several perfectly paced nozzles spray water or antifreeze window washer fluid at the windscreen using these methods.This mechanism also helps in the removal of dirt and dust from the windscreen only whhen utilised in conjunction with the wiper blades.In this project I explain about how Wiper working based on stm32,of which stm32 is an ARM based Microcontroller.
